When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 
  If I lose my local work (hard drive failure, careless deletion, etc.), I won't lose
  the rest of my progress.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  I may not want to bring commits other contributers made to the project to my local
  repository until I make certain commits of my own.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 
  If I lose my local work (hard drive failure, careless deletion, etc.), I won't lose
  the rest of my progress.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  I may not want to bring commits other contributers made to the project to my local
  repository until I make certain commits of my own.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks clone a repository from one user's remote repository to make a new remote repository
  without all the added work of needing to clone to and push from your local machine. This is great
  if I want to use someone else's code while both giving them credit and making changes that don't
  affect their repo. Clones involve copying a repository in a more general sense; local to local or
  remote to local. If someone adds me as a contributor or if I want to have a copy of a recently forked
  repo on my machine, clone is good. A branch is within a repo and is good for experimental changes and
  other commits you'd want to keep separate from your main branch.

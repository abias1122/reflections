Diff helped me spot specifically defects I've injected after making changes to a document.

Having easy access to the entire history of a file makes me more effiecient by removing the need to undo
changes made that either introdiced more bugs or added functionality you/stakeholders didn't end up wanting after all.

With manual commits, you can guaruntee that the commit will be at a logical breaking point. However, automatic commits 
can be helpful for forgetful people, or for text files.

Version control systems geared towards code, like git, save multiple fiels in one commit because source files tend to
depend on one another (e.g. HTML, JS, and CSS files). Systems like Google Drive is geared more towards files that
lack these contingencies, like text and slide files.

Version control makes me more confident when making potentially project-breaking changes because I can always go back to
previous versions to pinpoint where the defect was injected.

I want to use Git for the first few Android projects I do.

A repository is created when I initialize a repository. I need to do
 it so that I'll have a repository to work with.

The staging area is different from the working directory in that not all files
in the working directory will be in the staging area. A repository doesn't
contain staging areas, but staging areas become commits to be stored in a repository.
Staging areas are helpful because you may not want to track the changes of all files
within your working directory.

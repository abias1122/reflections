A repository is created when I initialize a repository. I need to do
 it so that I'll have a repository to work with.

The staging area is different from the working directory in that not all files
in the working directory will be in the staging area. A repository doesn't
contain staging areas, but staging areas become commits to be stored in a repository.
Staging areas are helpful because you may not want to track the changes of all files
within your working directory.

The staging area helps me make sure I only make one commit per logical change
by helping me manage which files changes made to will be committed.

Branches can help keep my history organized by keping different logical
groupings of functionality separate.

The diagrams help me visualize the branch structure by making it obvious
which commits can reach which other commits.

The result of the merge is that all of the changes made in the coins branch were brought
to the master branch. The diagram uses that representation because commits from both old
branches are brought into the new head of one of the branches.

Merging commits automatically usually involves less work, but doesn't always 
know which changes to keep. Manual merging is more work-intensive, but you can
make sure the right changes are kept.
